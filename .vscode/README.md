# VSCODE setup for NUMPDE

## Installation

Copy all the files in the folder into the directory `NPDECODES/.vscode` where `NPDECODES` is the
direcotory of your cloned homework git repository. You might have to create a folder named `.vscode`. Note that the `.` is important

## Usage

Make sure you followed the setup of the course homeworkproblems in Chapter 0. Then you should be able to debug
the code in the `mysolution` folder of the homeworkproblems by just opening the `.cc` file, setting breakpoints and starting the debugger.

## Remarks

The setup is not very well tested, so if you have your own solution that works, better use your own. Otherwise just write me an [email](mailto:grafn@student.ethz.ch) and I will try to fix it if I find some time.
